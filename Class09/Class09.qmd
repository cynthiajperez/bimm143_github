In today's class we will examine some data about Halloween candy from the 538 website

# Import Candy Data

```{r}
candy_file <- "candy-data.csv"

candy = read.csv(candy_file, row.names=1)
head(candy)
```

> Q1. How many different candy types are in this dataset?

There are `r nrow(candy)` in this dataset
```{r}
nrow(candy)
```


> Q2. How many fruity candy types are in the dataset?

There are `r sum(candy$fruity)` fruity candy in the dataset.
```{r}
sum(candy$fruity)
```

# What is your favorite candy?

> Q3. What is your favorite candy in the dataset and what is it’s winpercent value?

```{r}
candy["Snickers",]$winpercent
```

> Q4. What is the winpercent value for “Kit Kat”?

```{r}
candy["Kit Kat",]$winpercent
```

> Q5. What is the winpercent value for “Tootsie Roll Snack Bars”?

```{r}
candy["Tootsie Roll Snack Bars",]$winpercent
```

### Now we use the `skim()` function to give an overview of the candy dataset.
 
```{r}
skimr::skim(candy)
```

> Q6. Is there any variable/column that looks to be on a different scale to the majority of the other columns in the dataset?

The "winpercent" variable seems to be on a different scale compared to the other variables. It is not on a 0 to 1 scale as the other variables. 

> Q7. What do you think a zero and one represent for the candy$chocolate column?

A zero represents a candy that does not contain chocolate. A one represents a candy that does contain chocolate. 
```{r}
candy$chocolate
```

### Plotting a Histogram of the candy dataset

> Q8. Plot a histogram of winpercent values

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(candy, aes(winpercent))+
  geom_histogram(bins=10)
```
> Q9. Is the distribution of winpercent values symmetrical?

No the distribution is not symmetrical.

> Q10. Is the center of the distribution above or below 50%?

The center of the distribution is below 50%
```{r}
summary(candy$winpercent)
```

> Q11. On average is chocolate candy higher or lower ranked than fruit candy?

Chocolate candy is higher ranked on average than fruit candy
```{r}
chocolate.inds <- as.logical(candy$chocolate)
chocolate.win <- candy$winpercent[chocolate.inds]
mean(chocolate.win)

fruit.inds <- as.logical(candy$fruity)
fruit.win <- candy$winpercent[fruit.inds]
mean(fruit.win)
```

> Q12. Is this difference statistically significant?

Difference is statically significant from p value in t.test.
```{r}
t.test(chocolate.win, fruit.win)
```

# Overall Candy Rankings

> Q13. What are the five least liked candy types in this set?

The order function returns the indices that make the inout sorted. 
```{r}
head(candy[order(candy$winpercent),], n=5)

library(dplyr)
candy %>% arrange(winpercent) %>% head(5)
```

> Q14. What are the top 5 all time favorite candy types out of this set?

```{r}
tail(candy[order(candy$winpercent),], n=5)
```
> Q15. Make a first barplot of candy ranking based on winpercent values.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent, rownames(candy)) +
  geom_col()
```

> Q16. This is quite ugly, use the reorder() function to get the bars sorted by winpercent?

```{r}
#| fig-height: 10
#| fig-width: 7

ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy), winpercent)) +
  geom_col()

# use hash `|` symbol to render a larger plot image straight from the R code
```

We can improve the barplot to make it easier to read.

```{r}
#Save the last plot we made
ggsave("mybarplot.png", height = 10)
```
![Exported image of previous barplot that is larger so it is more legible](mybarplot.png)
Add custom colors to the bar plot
```{r}
#create vectors for each candy type you want displayed
my_cols= rep("gray", nrow(candy))
my_cols[candy$fruity ==1] <- "pink"
my_cols[candy$chocolate==1] <- "chocolate"
my_cols[candy$bar==1] <- "brown"

```


```{r}
#| fig-height: 10
#| fig-width: 7

ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy), winpercent)) +
  geom_col(fill=my_cols)
```
> Q17. What is the worst ranked chocolate candy?

The worst ranked chocolate candy is sixlets

> Q18. What is the best ranked fruity candy?

The best ranked fruity candy is Starburst


# Pricepercent

Plot of winpercent vs. pricepercent
```{r}
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, pricepercent, label=rownames(candy)) +
  geom_point(col=my_cols) +
  geom_label(col=my_cols)
```
The lables are overlapping with each other making it hard to read the plot. We can instal the `ggrepel` package to improve the legibility of the plot
```{r}
library(ggrepel)

ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, pricepercent, label=rownames(candy)) +
  geom_point(col=my_cols) + 
  geom_text_repel(col=my_cols, size=3.3, max.overlaps = 5)
```


> Q19. Which candy type is the highest ranked in terms of winpercent for the least money - i.e. offers the most bang for your buck?

Reese's miniatures
> Q20. What are the top 5 most expensive candy types in the dataset and of these which is the least popular?

Nik L Nip is the most expensive and least popular candy type. 
```{r}
ord <- order(candy$pricepercent, decreasing = TRUE)
head( candy[ord,c(11,12)], n=5 )
```


# Exploring Correlation Structure

```{r}
library(corrplot)

cij <- cor(candy)
cij

corrplot(cij)
```

> Q22. Examining this plot what two variables are anti-correlated (i.e. have minus values)?

Chocolate and fruity are anti-correlated

> Q23. Similarly, what two variables are most positively correlated?

Chocolate and bar are the most positively correlated variables

# Principal Component Analysis

We will perform a PCA of the candy. We must scale the data before performing the analysis.
```{r}
pca <- prcomp(candy, scale=TRUE)
summary (pca)
```
 Plot PC1 vs, PC2 using base R function `plot()`
```{r}
plot(pca$x[,1], pca$x[,2], col=my_cols, pch=15)
```
 Now try a PCA plot with `gpglot()`
```{r}
# We create a new data-frame with PCA results (PC1, PC2, PC3) and candy data
my_data <- cbind(candy, pca$x[,1:3])

p <- ggplot(my_data) + 
  aes(PC1, PC2, label=rownames(my_data), size=winpercent/100, label=rownames(my_data)) +
  geom_point(col=my_cols)+
  geom_text_repel(col=my_cols)
p
```
Add further details to plot to make it more legible
```{r}
p + geom_text_repel(size=2, col=my_cols, max.overlaps = 9)  + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(title="Halloween Candy PCA Space",
       subtitle="Colored by type: chocolate bar (dark brown), chocolate other (light brown), fruity (red), other (black)",
       caption="Data from 538")
```


We can look at the PCA loadings 
```{r}
head(pca$rotation)
```

Make a barplot withg ggplot and order the bars by their value. 
```{r}
res <- as.data.frame(pca$rotation)

ggplot(res) +
  aes(PC1, reorder(rownames(res),PC1)) +
  geom_col()
```


> Q24. What original variables are picked up strongly by PC1 in the positive direction? Do these make sense to you?

From the loadings we can see that fruity, hard, and pluribus are variables all strongly picked up by PC1 in the positive direction.
